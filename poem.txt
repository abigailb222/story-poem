From My Heart

A million stars up in the sky
One shines brighter I canâ€™t deny
A love so precious a love so true
A love that comes from me to you
The angels sing when you are near
Within your arms I have nothing to fear
You always know just what to say
Just talking to you makes my day
I love you honey with all of my heart
Together forever and never to part
